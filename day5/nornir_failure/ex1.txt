Create a simple custom task that generates an exception.

Use nr.run() to call this custom task.

In the main part of your program (just after your nr.run() call) print
out the following:

a. The 'aggr_results.failed' (in other words whether your custom task
failed or succeeded).

b. The '.exception' attribute from aggr_results['vmx1'].

c. The set of 'failed_hosts'.


Next 'recover' both 'vmx1' and 'vmx2' so they are no longer considered
failed.

Finally create a second custom task that just prints the 'name' of the
host that the task is executing on. Run this final task on ONLY the 
still failed hosts.
