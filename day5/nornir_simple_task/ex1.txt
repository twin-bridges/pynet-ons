Using the following config.yaml file create a Nornir object:

-------
inventory:
  plugin: nornir.plugins.inventory.simple.SimpleInventory
  options:
    host_file: "~/nornir_inventory/hosts.yaml"
    group_file: "~/nornir_inventory/groups.yaml"
    defaults_file: "~/nornir_inventory/defaults.yaml"
-------

After you have created the Nornir object use 'nr.run' to execute
Nornir on a custom task that you have created. Your custom task 
should be similar to the following:

def exercise_task(task):

    host = task.host
    msg = "Some Message"
    return msg

Ideally the message would contain the host's 'name', 'hostname', and
'port'.

Use Nornir's print_result() to print out the results of this custom task.
