Create the following Jinja2 file:

------
$ cat dns_ntp.j2 
set system name-server {{ dns1 }}
set system name-server {{ dns2 }}
set system ntp server {{ ntp1 }}
set system ntp server {{ ntp2 }}
------

Next add the two DNS servers and the two NTP servers to the junos group
in groups.yaml (in the 'data' field).

Now create a Nornir script and filter your inventory to only the 'junos'
devices.

Use the 'template-file' task-plugin to render the Jinja2 using inventory
variables. You will have to do this in a custom task and pass in
**task.host (to pass the variables in from the 'data' field).

Save the rendered config to 'task.host['config'] (so that it can be used
in a future Nornir task).

Finally, use the "napalm_configure" task-plugin to configure the rendered
configurations onto the junos devices. Once again you will need to do 
this in a custom task.

You will need to retrieve the configuration from task.host['config'].
