Execute the following script:

-------
from nornir import InitNornir


def my_task(task):
    return f"Host is {task.host.name}"


if __name__ == "__main__":

    import ipdb

    ipdb.set_trace()
    nr = InitNornir(config_file="config.yaml")
    aggr_results = nr.run(task=my_task)
-------

Using Pdb print out the aggr_results variable. What is the 'type' of this variable?

Which keys are available on the aggr_results variable?

Using Pdb assign the srx1 variable to be equal to aggr_results['srx1'].

What is the type of this newly create srx1 variable? What is the length of this
variable (use the 'len' function)?

Access srx1[0] and save this to a new variable named 'result'. What is the type of
this new variable named 'result'?

In this new result variable access the result attribute (i.e. result.result). What
is the value of this? Where in the program did this 'result.result' originate from?

Modify the program such that you change this 'result' message. Re-execute the program
and verify the result.result string for srx1 has this new value.
