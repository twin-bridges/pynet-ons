Create a Nornir script that establishes a NAPALM direct connection to
each of the Junos devices (in a custom task).

Use the 'napalm_obj.device' attribute to retrieve the underlying Juniper
PyEZ object.

Return the PyEZ 'facts' from the custom task.

Use the print_result() function in your main program to print out the
result from custom task (thus printing the device's PyEZ 'facts').
