Use the "napalm_get" plugin to retrieve the "config" getter from the
four Juniper lab devices.

Print the results out using the below Python code.

Note, the data structure returned from Nornir + NAPALM has some nesting
so you will need to access the ["config"]["running"] key in the result
(shown below).

-------
    for device_name, m_result in agg_result.items():
        print("-" * 50)
        print(device_name)
        print(m_result[0].result["config"]["running"])
        print("-" * 50)
